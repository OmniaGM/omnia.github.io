<p>Seems to be the hardest problem ever faced a Web developer</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve decided to make my website viewable with any Browser</p>
<p>But I couldn&#8217;t do so , unfortunately :(<!-- more --></p>
<p>I think the solution is in the simplicity, make a simple page everything is fine</p>
<p>But when I start showing some (muscles) I start losing some browsers</p>
<p>for example , my <a href="http://www.abdulradi.com/plane/">Flight booking system</a> I thought that IE is too dump to work probably</p>
<p>but I discovered after testing more browsers, that Firefox is too Smart</p>
<p>even my Home page .. I used XHTML, W3C Standards , and added non-Standards to Fix IE problems</p>
<p>Then &#8230; I figured that there are more browsers didn&#8217;t know W3C standards :D</p>
<p>Finally .. back to .. Best viewed with Firefox</p>
