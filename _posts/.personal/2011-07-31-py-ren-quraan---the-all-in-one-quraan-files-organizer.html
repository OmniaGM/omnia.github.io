<p>A year ago, exactly like today, I made a vow to make a program (any program) that has Islam flavor -before next Ramdan- , If I got excepted from military services.<br/>And I got excepted, also I got a very good job at Cloud9ers where Iearned Python, Of course I got very busy, and I don&#8217;t know how i realized that a year has passed, and Tada &#8230; Ramdan is tomorrow&#160;!!<br/>I didn&#8217;t write a decent line of code yet, <!-- more -->all I&#8217;ve done is some researches and some paper designing.<br/>So .. I&#8217;ve no another solution &#8230; I made the program :D One year works made in 2 hours only .. OMG I am such a lazy engineer&#160;!! deadlines are a bliss.</p>
<p>This is the URL of my program<br/><a href="http://code.google.com/p/py-ren-quraan/">http://code.google.com/p/py-ren-quraan/</a></p>
<p>Currently it uses aspell program to auto-correct Quraan file names in your disk, the current version is console only, and not -yet- configurable ( you may hack the code if you want )<br/>Next versions may have a GUI, may use CDDB to get info about files, may also set mp3 tags.<br/>The program is away from being done, your help/support is very appreciated.</p>
