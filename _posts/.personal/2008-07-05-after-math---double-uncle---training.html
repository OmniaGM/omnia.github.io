<p>Math 4 Exam&#160;: Well Thanks Allah , We had the same exam of the previous year, the one which I &#8220;basmagt&#8221; :D</p>
<p>After Math&#160;? Kan fe Gamsa &#8230; then rege3t 3al 5abar el lateef</p>
<p>Well I am not only Uncle , I am Double Uncle&#160;!!</p>
<p>Actually &#8216;Omar Ahmed Abdul Radi&#8217;  made it to the world at 25/6/2008</p>
<p>Unfortunately no pictures available because my mobile is DEAD :D</p>
<p>Later,<!-- more --></p>
<p>I went to Cairo for training</p>
<p>actually I had a training in <strong>MCV </strong><em>aka Mercedes</em></p>
<p>First day I had the most horrible trip<img class="mceWPmore" src="http://localhost/wordpress/wp-includes/js/tinymce/plugins/wordpress/img/trans.gif" title="More..."/>ever , whick took me 3.5 hours  to arrive to Mercides factory at New Salheyya City</p>
<p>where I got shocked&#160;! Well it is the Deparment name again :s</p>
<p>They decided that we are intersted in IT only&#160;! and we don&#8217;t have anything to do with <strong>Control</strong></p>
<p>So We has our training in IT deparment :s</p>
<p>Fortunately, the head of the IT deparment , <em>Eng. Mohammed Bakr</em> , was &#8220;ragel gada3 fash5&#8221;</p>
<p>He called some friends of him to let us have Control Training</p>
<p>he also gave us his number and took our&#8217;s, and helped us very much</p>
<p>The next days were much easier , as we figured out much easier ways  to travel from Madient Nasr toNew Salhyya City</p>
<p>Now it takes us 2 hours , using our friend&#8217;s car to Al Oboour , then from el Obour we take Mercides&#8217; Bus</p>
<p>Later I finished my week , and I am supposed to return to Mansoura</p>
<p>Well, Another  horrible trip , I started the journey at 6pm , and I arrived at 12 am&#160;!!!</p>
<p>No Comment.</p>
<p>And Now I am writing these lines from Mansoura</p>
<p>it is all about several hours and I&#8217;ll be in my way back to MCV</p>
<p>but I firured out a new route :D I&#8217;ll go to <em>Ismallia </em>and the to <em>Assaseen </em>where I&#8217;ll get a cab to MCV</p>
<p>Ya RAB bas el mawdoo3 yetla3 mazboot w ma netoohsh</p>
