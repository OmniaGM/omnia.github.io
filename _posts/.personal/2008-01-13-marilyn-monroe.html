<p><strong>Marilyn Monroe</strong> <em>(born Norma Jeane Mortenson</em>, June 1, 1926 – August 5, 1962), American actress, model, Hollywood icon, and sex symbol&#8230;..</p>
<p>I was reading , while I ran into her name, I don&#8217;t know what made me search about here..</p>
<p>OK, her nude pictures were flooding Google images, But Only one picture caught my attention.</p>

<p><img src="http://img108.imageshack.us/img108/2299/marilynmonroese1.jpg"/> Yes This is She :s</p>
<p>Marilyn Monroe was found dead from an overdose of sleeping pills on August 5, 1962, by her housekeeper Eunice Murray. She was naked, atop her telephone on her bed, with unhealthy levels of barbiturates in her bloodstream. But the typical signs of barbiturate overdose were completely absent.</p>
<p>Supposedly, Monroe had had an abortion at Cedars of Lebanon Hospital on the 20th of July. It has been said that she had as many as a dozen abortions over the years. But certainly it is well known that she was terminated by her job at Fox Studio. And there were problems with her relationship with Robert F Kennedy; he was not returning her calls.</p>
<p>Evidence is missing, including the original autopsy, her supposed suicide note (which mentioned suicide not at all), and original police report. Furthermore, the first officer at the death scene has publicly disputed the suicide finding.</p>
<p>In 1985, a 20/20 episode was to air where Robert Slatzer postulates that Monroe was killed by Bobby Kennedy, or was in his presence when she died. The show is cancelled.</p>
<p>Marilyn is buried at Westwood Memorial Cemetery.</p>
