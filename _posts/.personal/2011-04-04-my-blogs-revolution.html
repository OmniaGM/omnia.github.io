<p>As I revolutionist, I decided to make a revolution on my old website ( which sucks :D)<br/>and create a unified design for my homepage and Blog</p>
<p>I am currently creating mockups for my website, using GIMP</p>
<p>P.S: Thanks for C9, I used before to code Javascript before I design a page&#160;!!!! :D</p>
