<p>Well I have been ages searching for the perfect borio</p>
<p>for people who don&#8217;t know .. Borio is a drink mainly made of the well known biscuits &#8220;Borio&#8221;</p>
<p>After testing Casablanca&#8217;s and Karbozy&#8217;s &#8230; I figured out my own Borio<!-- more --></p>
<p>Get 2 Big Borios , and 1 small ( 15 pieces of Borio )</p>
<p>more than a half Glass of Milk</p>
<p>1 Chixo , and some Nesquik</p>
<p>Now prepare 13 of the Borios, Chixo ( not all of it .. leave some), some Nesquik , may be sugar too<br/>Put them all in your Mixer .. and Mix :D</p>
<p>here is the trick .. how much should you leave the Mixer .. I think it depends .. but don&#8217;t leave it too much</p>
<p>Now .. Get your self a nice Glass ;)</p>
<p>You may put at the top of the Borio some Chixo , and the remaining 2 Borios after breaking then into small pieces</p>
<p>Enjoy your Borio ;)</p>
