<p>Well,<a href="http://blog.abdulradi.com/?p=93"> I made a decision to a design/code my own WordPress theme.</a></p>
<p>My problem is that I didn&#8217;t know how to do it! :D</p>
<p>I have never made a WP theme before, didn&#8217;t write PHP for ages, plus I suck when it comes to designing and colors :D, anyway I started!</p>
<p>During my jurney I learned a lot of things, and I wanted to share, so &#8230;</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll post a blog post for each step in do in my theme, and this page will be the index.</p>

<li>Designing pages</li>
<li>HTMLing/CSSing the design</li>
</ol><p>Note: This page is still under-construction, I am sorry If I am taking much time to post updates, as I am working on this for a few hours in my weekend.</p>
