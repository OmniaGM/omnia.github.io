title: Blog’s Theme Mockup

<p>First step in designing my blog&#8217;s theme was the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mockup">Mockup</a>,</p>
<p>First I&#8217;d like to thank <a href="http://localhost/wordpress/wp-admin/www.cloud9ers.com">C9</a>, and <a href="http://twitter.com/ho_ba">HO_BA</a> as I didn&#8217;t know this step 6 months ago! I used to decide the look of the website after writing the JavaScript! (don&#8217;t ask me how :D)<!-- more --></p>
<h3>What is Mockup&#160;?</h3>
<p>In manufacturing and design, a <strong>mockup</strong>, or <strong>mock-up</strong>, is a scale or full-size model of a design or device, used for teaching, demonstration, design evaluation, promotion, and other purposes.</p>
<h3>Mockups, How to&#160;?</h3>
<p>Software UI mockups can range from very simple hand drawn screen layouts, through realistic bitmaps, to semi functional user interfaces developed in a software development tool.</p>
<p>For me, I used an excellent tool called <a href="https://gomockingbird.com/mockingbird/">Mockingbird</a>, it gives you a free account, very limited but enough for personal use.</p>
<p>Mock-ups could be very hard to start from scratch for ordinary websites, but for a WordPress theme, you have a variety of themes that could inspire you, however you have to list what you want to show in your website</p>
<p>For me this list was dependent on the page, It didn&#8217;t want the homepage to look like the post page, I had my reasons</p>
<h3>Example: Home page</h3>
<p><a href="http://blog.abdulradi.com/wp-content/1.-Home.png"><img alt="the mockup for the Home page" class="size-medium wp-image-123 alignright" height="300" src="http://blog.abdulradi.com/wp-content/1.-Home-260x300.png" title="Home page mockup" width="260"/></a></p>
<p>Ofcourse I won&#8217;t tell you how to make a mock-up, mockingbird is easy as drag &amp; drop, but I&#8217;ll give you some advices</p>
<ol><li>Don&#8217;t focus on design aspects, like colors.</li>
<li>Decide what to show on the page and why, and prioritize them</li>
<li>When you are stuck, have a look on other themes for inspiration</li>
</ol><p>In this page on the right, I wanted to show&#8230; (Sorted by priority)</p>
<ol><li>Latest Posts teasers and post-controls (comment, read more, like, share, etc&#8230;)</li>
<li>A search box for my Blogs</li>
<li>Twitter &amp; FB integration</li>
<li>Latest comments</li>
<li>About me</li>
<li>Tag Cloud</li>
<li>Blog Roll</li>
</ol><p>Of course it is up to you to decide the layout for your page(s).</p>
