<p>I&#8217;ve just finished my Python course, I was very glad to convert .Net developers into opensource world, they seemed to like Python, Thanks to Allah :).</p>
<p>We covered the basics of python, and it&#8217;s good practices, conventions and of course Magic. I gave them an fast introduction to  Django, as they were interested in Web Development .</p>
<p>God bless Open Source, God bless Egypt :).</p>
